I believe that storytelling is a key part of growing and engaging your audience and your website needs to reflect that. My goal is to take your ideas and transform them into beautiful responsive websites which are user focused and accessible. My approach is collaborative and flexible, keeping you in control from start to finish. I have strong skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Liquid, and am working towards proficiency with React and Photoshop.
